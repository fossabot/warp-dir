This is a ruby implementation of the tool 'wd' (warp directory),
[originally written as a zsh module](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd)
by [Markus Færevaag](https://github.com/mfaerevaag).

After finding it very useful, but having to switch to `bash` on occasion, I wanted to have a completely
compatible tool that is well tested, and can be extended to do some more interesting things.

Markus kindly offered a ruby version in a [separate branch of this module](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd/tree/ruby),
which served as an inspiration for this gem.

The overall concept comes from the realization that when we work on the command line, we

 * often have to deal with a limited number of folders at any given time
 * it would be nice to quickly switch between these folders (which we call __warp points__).
 * it should be easy to add, remove, list, and validate warp points
 * everything should require as few characters as possible :)

Some future extensions could be based on some additional realizations:

 * each folder often represents a project, some of which are managed by `git`
 * eventually we might want to do things across all projects, such as perform group `git pull`,
   or even `git push` etc.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'warp-dir'
```
And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install warp-dir --no-ri --no-rdoc
    
After the installation, you will have the `warp-dir` command in the path. You can use
this command almost like `wd` except it can not warp you to another folder due to 
UNIX parent/child process restrictions. To do that you need to also install the shell
function wrapper in your `~/.bashrc` or similar file:

You can do like so (if you don't provide file, it will install in `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`
or `~/.zshrc` – so use `--file` to override).

    $ warp-dir install [ --file <file> ]

And after that you need to restart your sheel, and then you should be able to get the 
helpful message below by typing:

    $ wd help

If the above command returns a properly formatted help like the image below, your setup
is now complete!

## Usage

The usage of the tool is a derived superset of the `ZSH`-based inspiration.

#### Notable Differences

 * instead of `wd add!` use `wd add -f <point>` (or --force)

These features will be added shortly:

 * for now `wd clean` is not supported 
 * for now history is not supported
 * for now '-' is not supported
 
## Future Development

I have so many cool ideas about where this can go, that I created a 
[dedicated page](ROADMAP.md) for the discussion of future features.  Please head over
there if you'ld like to participate.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will
allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and
then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the
version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file
to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Adding New Commands

Just follow the patter in the `lib/warp/dir/commands/` folder, copy and modify
one of the existing commands.  Command class name is used as an actual command.
