# Warp Directory

This is a ruby implementation of the tool 'wd' (warp directory), 
[originally written as a zsh module](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd) 
by [Markus FÃ¦revaag](https://github.com/mfaerevaag).

After finding it very useful, but having to switch to `bash` on occasion, I wanted to have a completely
compatible tool that is well tested, and can be extended to do some more interesting things.

Markus kindly offered a ruby version in a [separate branch of this module](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd/tree/ruby),
which served as an inspiration for this gem.

The overall concept comes from the realization that when we work on the command line, we 

 * often have to deal with a limited number of folders at any given time
 * it would be nice to quickly switch between these folders (which we call __warp points__).
 * it should be easy to add, remove, list, and validate warp points
 * everything should require as few characters as possible :) 

Some future extensions could be based on some additional realizations:

 * each folder often represents a project, some of which are managed by `git`
 * eventually we might want to do things across all projects, such as perform group `git pull`, 
   or even `git push` etc.
 
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
    gem 'warp_dir'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install warp_dir

## Usage

The usage of the tool is a direct clone of it's `zsh`-based inspiration.  

```
  > wd --help
  Usage: wd [command] <point>
  
  Commands:
  add <point>	  Adds the current working directory to your warp points
  add! <point>	Overwrites existing warp point
  rm <point>	  Removes the given warp point
  show		      Print warp points to current directory
  show <point>	Print path to given warp point
  list	        Print all stored warp points
  ls  <point>   Show files from given warp point
  path <point>  Show the path to given warp point
  clean!		    Remove points warping to nonexistent directories
  
  -v | --version	Print version
  -d | --debug	  Exit after execution with exit codes (for testing)
  -c | --config	  Specify config file (default ~/.warprc)
  -q | --quiet	  Suppress all output
  
  help		Show this extremely helpful text
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. 
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will 
allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and 
then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the 
version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file 
to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
